 *   refuses with a clear message or spawns the detached worker and returns immediately — this

 *   the worker itself has none).
 * - **Worker** (`runDaemonWorker`, the detached child): the actual long-running loop
 *   (`scheduler/loop.ts#runDaemon`), until a POSIX signal asks it to stop or `decideLockAcquisition`
 *   refuses outright (another instance won the race).

 * (`handleLeadTimeWarning`'s `saveState`, `runEndOfDay`'s `saveState`, the day-rollover `saveState`)

 * across two poll iterations. So a stop landing between polls loses nothing, by construction: the
 * next `seeya daemon` starts from the exact same `estado.json` this one would have. The one thing
 * this sentence does NOT cover is a stop landing INSIDE an in-flight poll (e.g. mid-capture) that
 * gets killed before that poll's own `saveState` runs — nothing is corrupted then either (the write
 * simply never happened), but that specific capture attempt is not counted
 * (`core/capture-retry.ts#recordCaptureAttempts` only runs after `endDay` resolves) and is retried
