/**
 * Shared `--session <value>` resolution for `end-day-command.ts` and `start-day-selection.ts`
 * (docs/ESPECIFICACAO.md § `seeya end-day`/`seeya start-day`; docs/PLANO-DE-ENTREGA.md S3-T5).
 * Both commands match the same kind of candidate — something with a `sessionId`, a `cwd` and a
 * display `name` — against the same single typed value, and both need the same hard rule: **an
 * ambiguous match is never resolved on this module's own behalf.** `end-day --session` can
 * terminate the process it resolves to (D-002); picking one candidate out of several that all
 * matched would be inventing a choice the evidence doesn't sustain (D-025), in exactly the command
 * where guessing wrong is expensive.
 *
 * Before this task, both commands matched only by exact `sessionId` or exact `cwd` string
 * equality — ambiguity was structurally invisible because `cwd` collisions (dozens of sessions
 * launched from the same directory, the case that motivated S3-T5) simply passed every matching
 * session through in `end-day-command.ts`'s case, or silently returned whichever `Array#find` saw
 * first in `start-day-selection.ts`'s. Both were "choosing wrong is cheap to do by accident";
 * this module is what makes that impossible going forward.

 *    ambiguous, even if `value` also happens to prefix- or name-match some other candidate.
 * 2. **Everything else, gathered together.** `sessionId` prefix, exact display `name`, and
 *    normalized `cwd` (`core/cwd-normalization.ts`) are evaluated as one combined test per
 *    candidate — not tried one method at a time — because the ambiguity rule cares about how many
 *    DISTINCT candidates matched `value` at all, not which method each one matched through. Zero
 *    is `notFound`; exactly one is `found`; two or more is `ambiguous`, naming every match so the
 *    caller can ask the person to be more specific (e.g. paste the full `sessionId`).
 *
 * @example
 * resolveSessionReference(sessions, toReference, '20632abc') // prefix match
 * resolveSessionReference(sessions, toReference, 'code-6d')  // display-name match
