/**
 * `seeya end-day [--dry-run] [--session <value>]` (docs/ESPECIFICACAO.md § `seeya end-day`,
 * extended by docs/PLANO-DE-ENTREGA.md S3-T5). Resolves `--session` to at most one discovered
 * session BEFORE `application/endDay` ever runs (`cli/session-reference.ts`), then calls `endDay`
 * with an exact-`sessionId` filter and turns the result into the plain-text report
 * (`format-end-day.ts`). No I/O happens here directly beyond that one resolving discovery call —
 * everything else `endDay` already did (or, under `--dry-run`, stopped right before doing it).
 *
 * **Why resolve before calling `endDay`, instead of passing a looser predicate straight through
 * like before S3-T5.** `EndDayOptions.sessionFilter` narrows AFTER `endDay`'s own discovery, at
 * which point captures (and, for `canTerminate: true` sessions, process termination, D-002) have
 * already happened for anything the predicate let through. A predicate that could match more than
 * one session — `candidate.cwd === session`, when dozens of sessions share a `cwd`, is exactly the
 * case S3-T5 exists for — would silently capture (and potentially terminate) all of them with no
 * chance to object first. Resolving here, against a fresh discovery snapshot, is what makes
 * ambiguity refusable instead of already-acted-on.
