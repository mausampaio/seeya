/**
 * The discovered session — the central type of the whole project (S1-T1).
 *
 * **Discriminated union on `hasPid`, required by D-024.** The review of S1-T0c measured that
 * `pid?: number` on a single type protects only by comment: `item.pid!` compiles without error,
 * and nothing in the type stops `terminateGracefully(item.pid!)`. Here there is no path to that:
 * `SessionWithPid` carries a guaranteed `pid` (`number`, never `undefined`); `SessionWithoutPid`
 * doesn't have the `pid` field at all. The process-termination policy (D-002) accepts only the
 * first shape — see `core/termination.ts#processTerminationData`, which only types for
 * `SessionWithPid`. Whoever holds a `DiscoveredSession` (the union) has to narrow with
 * `if (session.hasPid)` before being able to call that function; the compiler refuses the call
 * without the narrowing, with no `!` at the call site.
 *
 * **Why `hasPid` instead of inferring from the presence of `pid`.** An explicit discriminant
 * (`hasPid: true | false`) makes the `switch`/`if` obvious to the reader and to TypeScript, and
 * avoids depending on `'pid' in session` or on checking `pid !== undefined` scattered through
 * the code — the discriminant is the only place that decides the shape.
 *
 * **Known limitation, in the same spirit as D-019's.** The type covers carelessness — passing a
 * `SessionWithoutPid`, or the un-narrowed union, straight to `processTerminationData` — not a
 * deliberate workaround: `{ hasPid: true } as SessionWithPid` compiles, and
 * `{ ...sessionWithoutPid, hasPid: true } as SessionWithPid` too. That is how `as` behaves on an
 * object literal in TypeScript, not a hole in this design — only the direct cast of an
 * already-typed value (`sessionWithoutPid as SessionWithPid`, without spreading) is refused,
 * because `SessionWithoutPid` and `SessionWithPid` don't overlap enough for the compiler to
 * accept the direct conversion. What D-024 promises, and what this type delivers, is that
 * `item.pid!` and narrowing-free access don't compile — not that no `as` in the whole project can
 * produce a lying value. Deliberate workarounds with `as` go through review, same as any other
 * `as` in the project.
 *
 * **This union briefly had a third shape and a second discriminant, `hasSessionId` — reverted by
 * D-029, S1-T11.** D-023 (S1-T10) added a discovery strategy for a `.key` file with no matching
 * `.json`, cross-checked against the live OS process for `cwd` and command line: a session with a
 * guaranteed `pid` but no `sessionId` at all (`SessionWithoutSessionId`), which needed
 * `hasSessionId` to stay type-safe alongside `hasPid`. D-029 revoked D-023 — the cause it
 * attributed to the phenomenon didn't hold up under measurement, and the cost (a third union
 * shape, per-OS process enumeration, command-line capture with its own privacy question, Q-011)
 * was disproportionate to what was actually observed. With the third shape gone, `hasSessionId`
 * would be `true` on every remaining shape — a discriminant that never discriminates, just a
 * field every caller has to keep writing for no compiler benefit — so it's gone too, and
 * `sessionId` moves back to `CommonSessionFields` below, where it lived before S1-T10: both
 * remaining shapes have always had it, and TypeScript already allows reading a field common to
 * every member of a union without narrowing first. If this reads oddly short next to the amount
 * of history above, that's why — see D-029 for the full account.

 * representable.
 *
 * - `resumeFailed` — `claude --resume` itself exited non-zero, and did so fast (before
 *   `adapters/resumption/spawn-interactive.ts`'s grace period, which a real interactive session
 *   always clears). D-025 governs the shape here on purpose: this names only what's known (the

 *   expired session, a project that moved) explained it, because a bare exit code can't say, and
 *   `seeya` never got the real terminal's stderr to look at (it went straight to the user's
 *   screen, not to a pipe this port could read).
 * - `promptTooLarge` — the prompt is longer than the positional-argument size threshold Spike H
 *   measured, so `--resume` was never attempted with it as an argument at all: better to know the
 *   ceiling in advance than to find it by failing (D-015's corrected text). This is the ONE reason
 *   that ever offers a real question with more than "open a fresh session or skip" — V2-T7's own
 *   third answer, "resume without the plan", only ever applies here (item 1 of that task).
 * - `resumeWithoutPlanFailed` (V2-T7) — the person answered "resume without the plan" for a
 *   `promptTooLarge` fallback, `SessionResumer.resumeWithoutPrompt()` was tried, and IT ALSO exited
 *   non-zero fast. Distinct from `resumeFailed` on purpose: that one is the ORIGINAL `--resume`
 *   attempt (with the plan as an argument) failing, this one is a SEPARATE attempt (no argument at
 *   all) failing after the person already chose it — same D-025 discipline (name the exit code,
 *   never guess why), different wording (`core/resume-notice.ts#describeFallbackReason`) because
 *   it's a different fact. Never asked about again (docs/PLANO-DE-ENTREGA.md V2-T7 item 2: "sem
