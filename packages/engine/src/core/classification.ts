 * timestamp that has already passed the limit. `null` isn't a very old timestamp, it's the
 * absence of any data about writing (no transcript, or a suppressed transcript — D-013): there's
 * no way to establish "no write for more than X minutes" when there's no way to establish
 * anything about writing. Treating `null` as "idle" would convert "I don't know" into a positive
 * claim — exactly what D-025 forbids for the whole domain. `alive` (the caller returns `alive`
 * when this function returns `false`) is the least specific state that a live process already
 * supports on its own, and that's what's left when write evidence is missing.
 *
 * Concrete case that motivated the fix: a session without a transcript because of D-013 is
 * exactly the autonomous execution agent, which has every reason to be working at full speed.
 * Marking it `idle` with no evidence of inactivity would confidently lie about the case that
 * matters most.
