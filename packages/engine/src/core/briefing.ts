/**
 * Renders the day's consolidated briefing — `~/.seeya/days/<day>/summary.md`
 * (docs/ESPECIFICACAO.md § "Formato do handoff": "gerado a partir dos handoffs, em markdown
 * legível"). Pure formatting: no I/O, no `Date.now()` read here (D-019) — `generatedAt` is the
 * caller's already-resolved `Clock.now()` — so this is testable with plain `Handoff` fixtures,
 * no adapter doubles needed. `application/` calls `StorageAdapter#listHandoffs` to gather the
 * inputs and `#saveBriefing` to persist the result; this module only turns one into the other.
 *
 * **D-022, all the way to the page a person reads.** `rejected` isn't decoration: a corrupted or
 * hand-edited handoff file never takes the rest of the day's briefing down
 * (`Storage#listHandoffs`), and this module is what makes that fact visible to a human instead of
 * just survivable in code — "N sessions captured, M entries unreadable" is D-022's "aceitos e
 * rejeitados" contract reaching the one place someone actually looks at the end of the day.
 *
 * **D-025, written as prose instead of a data field, is where it's easiest to lose.** Two states
 * this module never launders into "nothing happened":
 * - `source: "deterministic"` — the model failed, not the session. The facts are real; nobody
 *   has explained them yet. Folding that into quiet prose ("worked on the thing") would make a
 *   failed generation indistinguishable from a session with genuinely little going on.
 * - `capturedDuringActiveTurn: true` — the capture landed mid-turn; some fields may lag reality
 *   by a few seconds. Silence here would let a reader treat a possibly-incomplete snapshot as a
 *   settled one.
 * Both surface as first-order lines next to the session, not footnotes.
 *
 * **S4-T0c: the artifact itself now says whether the run that produced it was a full day or a
 * `--session`-narrowed slice.** Q-041 surfaced the gap: `seeya end-day --session X` used to write a
 * `summary.md` indistinguishable from a full day that happened to have one session. A reader
 * finding no other handoffs would read that as "nothing else was going on" — D-025's mistake one
 * level up from a single field, applied to the whole document. `renderScopeNote` below states the
 * scope explicitly for BOTH cases (never omitting the full-day note and letting silence mean
 * "complete" — the exact ambiguity this task exists to close), right after the generation
 * timestamp and before anything else, because a reader needs this before interpreting the rest of
 * the page.
 *
 * **S4-T0d amends the last claim S4-T0c made here.** This used to say `endDay` only knows a filter
 * ran, not what it skipped — wrong, and verified in the code: `application/end-day.ts#
 * applyCaptureScope` holds `captureCandidates` and `sessionsInScope` side by side in the same
 * function, so "how many were discarded" is a subtraction of two arrays already in hand, not a fact
 * `endDay` lacks (the premise was wrong in `docs/QUESTOES.md` Q-041 too — see its own CORREÇÃO).
 * `renderScopeNote` below now states that count. What it still never claims is WHICH sessions the
 * filter discarded — that's a different, riskier claim (identities, not a count) that
 * `docs/PLANO-DE-ENTREGA.md` S4-T0d keeps out of scope on purpose, not an oversight repeated twice.
