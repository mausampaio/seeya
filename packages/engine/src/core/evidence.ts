/**
 * Builds the `EvidenceSignature` D-026's anti-duplication compares — one token per source, from
 * the same `HandoffFacts` a handoff itself persists (`core/types.ts`). Deliberately covers only
 * `transcript` and `git`: D-026's own text names exactly these two ("última atividade do
 * transcript quando existe, e o estado do git"), never `registry` — a live session's registry
 * facts (`cwd`, `name`, start time) don't change over the course of a day the way transcript
 * activity or a git tree do, so there is no meaningful "changed since this morning" signal to
 * compare there.
 *
 * Called on both sides of a comparison: on freshly gathered facts (`currentSignature`) and, by
 * reading a previous handoff's own persisted `facts` back through this same function, on
 * `previousCaptureToday.signature` — no separate "signature" field is persisted in the handoff
 * document at all (docs/ESPECIFICACAO.md's "Formato do handoff" doesn't show one, and D-026 left
 * the exact format to whoever implemented S2-T3); reconstructing it from `facts` avoids inventing
 * a disk key the spec doesn't already have.
 *
 * **This ties D-026's anti-duplication to the STABILITY of this reconstruction, not just to
 * `facts` themselves (docs/QUESTOES.md Q-021, item 3).** `sameEvidence` has no way to know
 * whether the two signatures it's comparing were built by the same rules — it only sees strings.
 * If `HandoffFacts` or this function's own field selection ever changes shape (a field renamed,
 * `gitToken`'s field list edited, a new source added) in a way that changes what a given set of
 * facts maps to, an OLD persisted handoff's facts run back through the NEW version of this
 * function would silently compare against a signature built by different rules than the one it
 * was captured with — `sameEvidence` would still return an answer, just possibly the wrong one,
 * with no error and no visible sign anything changed. The fix, if that ever becomes a real
 * constraint (a schema migration touches `facts`, for instance), is to persist the signature as
 * its own versioned disk field instead of reconstructing it — the same tradeoff `schemaVersion`
 * already exists to manage for the rest of the document.
 *
 * @example
 * const signature = buildEvidenceSignature(handoff.facts); // { transcript: "...", git: "..." }
