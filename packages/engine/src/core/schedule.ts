/**
 * S4-T2's pure scheduling rule (docs/ESPECIFICACAO.md § "Comportamento do daemon"): given
 * `Config`, today's `DayState` and the current instant, what should happen right now? No I/O, no
 * `new Date()`/`Date.now()` (D-019) — `now` always arrives as a parameter, resolved by whoever
 * calls this from the `Clock` port (the daemon, S4-T3).
 *
 * **Why a discriminated union, not a boolean (D-024).** "Nothing to do" has at least four
 * different causes here (disabled, skipped, already ended today, still early) and "something to
 * do" has two (a specific lead-time warning, or the end-of-day closure — possibly late). A
 * `{ fire: boolean }` — or even `{ fire: boolean; late: boolean }` — would force every caller to
 * re-derive which of those it actually got by inspecting other fields, and would make at least one
 * wrong state representable (e.g. `{ fire: false, late: true }`, which means nothing). See
 * `ScheduleDecision` below for the full list of cases and `docs/QUESTOES.md` Q-037 for the design
 * choices this file makes that aren't literal in the spec.
 *
 * **This module has no memory** — every function here is a pure `(inputs) => output`. The "don't
 * repeat a notification" requirement (docs/ESPECIFICACAO.md's daemon loop fires the same lead-time
 * instant on every 30s poll it's crossed on) is solved the same way `core/early-warnings.ts`
 * already solves it for a different trigger: `decideSchedule` returns the bookkeeping to persist
 * next (`nextState`) alongside the decision, and the caller only carries it forward after actually
 * acting on the decision — this file never assumes an action succeeded.

 * Resolves `"HH:MM"` (already validated 24h local time by
 * `adapters/storage/config-schema.ts` — this function trusts the shape, same as every other
 * `core/` rule trusts its typed input) against `referenceDay`'s local calendar day into a concrete
 * instant. `docs/ARQUITETURA.md` § "Fusos e horários": "a conversão para instante acontece por
 * dia, no fuso do sistema, o que trata mudança de horário de verão de graça" — `new Date(year,
 * month, day, hours, minutes)` IS that conversion (D-019 permits a deterministic `Date`
 * construction from already-known values); this function does no DST arithmetic of its own, it
 * just hands the platform the wall-clock numbers and lets the timezone database decide what
 * instant they mean today, the same way `adapters/git/local-day.ts#localDayBounds` already does
 * for day boundaries.
 *
 * **The entry day of daylight saving — a configured time that never happens.** Measured on
 * Node/V8 (`TZ=America/New_York`, spring-forward 2026-03-08, clocks jump 02:00→03:00 so "02:30"
 * never occurs that day): `new Date(2026, 2, 8, 2, 30)` normalizes to **03:30 local**, not 01:30
 * and not a thrown error. This function doesn't special-case it — rejecting an "impossible"
 * configured time would mean `core/` carrying its own DST transition table, exactly what "no fuso
 * do sistema, de graça" exists to avoid — and the platform's own normalization always lands AFTER
 * the gap, never before it: closing 30 minutes later than configured one morning a year is a far
 * smaller cost than a scheduler that throws, or silently never closes, because the configured
 * minute briefly didn't exist.
 *
 * **The exit day — a configured time that happens twice.** Measured the same way (fall-back
 * 2026-11-01, clocks fall 02:00→01:00, so "01:30" occurs once in daylight time and again an hour
 * later in standard time): `new Date(2026, 10, 1, 1, 30)` resolves to the EARLIER (still-daylight)
 * occurrence. Same reasoning: this is the platform's own disambiguation rule, not one this project
 * invented, and there is no information available here (a bare `"HH:MM"` string) that could
 * justify picking the later one instead.
