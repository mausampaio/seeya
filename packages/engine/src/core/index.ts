 * Core: pure domain rules and ports.

 * Imports no `node:*` nor anything from `application/`, `cli/` or `adapters/`. No I/O, no
 * clock, no network, no process. See docs/ARQUITETURA.md.
 *
 * Convenience barrel (S1-T1). Whoever prefers can import directly from the specific module
 * (e.g. `core/classification.js`) — both paths work.
