 * The spec's first two conditions — "at least one evidence source answered" and "had activity in
 * the last `relevanceHours` ... measured by the most recent source available" — are two faces
 * of the same field, `session.lastActivity`. With no source answering, there's no way to compute
 * "the most recent source" — so `lastActivity === null` is already both things at once: zero
 * evidence **and**, as a consequence, zero provably recent activity. That's why the two
 * conditions are mutually exclusive here (never both reasons together): no evidence is reported
 * as `noEvidence`; evidence present but outside the window, as `noRecentActivity`.
 *
 * The fifth condition, anti-duplication (D-026), compares `criteria.currentSignature` with the
 * signature of today's last capture via `sameEvidence` — never `session.lastTranscriptWrite`
 * directly, because that kept any transcript-less session "duplicate" for the whole day even if
 * its git tree had changed (the exact case of the autonomous execution agent, D-013).
 *
 * That same condition only fires when `previousCaptureToday.source === 'model'` (S4-T00e). A
 * `deterministic` handoff is the record that generation was attempted and FAILED; a
 * `noTranscript` one is the record that it was never attempted at all. Neither is a verdict from
 * the model about this session's state — treating either as "already captured" would apply D-025
 * (absence of data never becomes a positive claim) backwards: it would let the *absence* of an
 * understanding stand in for the *presence* of one, permanently consuming the day's only capture
 * window on a session a transient failure (budget, network, model down) never actually looked at.
 * Q-026 is the same reasoning one layer up, for `pendingItems` instead of anti-duplication.
