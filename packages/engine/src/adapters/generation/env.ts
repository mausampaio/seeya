 * itself (this project is developed that way) — without this, the child inherits
 * `CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION` and loses its transcript (Spike D), silently. Observed live on this
 * machine while implementing this task: `CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION`, `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`,
 * `CLAUDE_PID` and `CLAUDECODE` were all set in the very shell used to spawn `claude` for the
 * manual measurements this task's docstrings cite.
 *
 * Pure and synchronous on purpose: no I/O, easy to unit-test (docs/TESTES.md § Unidade,
 * "Sanitização de ambiente (D-017)") without spawning anything real.
