/**
 * The short `--system-prompt` sent to every generation call (D-011, Spike C's second finding).
 * Spike C measured the default assistant persona producing 2,349 tokens of free prose ending in
 * an offer to "adapt this into an artifact" — the opposite of what a fact extractor should do.
 * This pins the role instead of hoping the model infers it from context.
 *
 * A single constant shared by both `LeanHandoffGenerator` and `DeepHandoffGenerator`: the role
 * ("extractor, not assistant") doesn't change between capture modes, only how much context each
 * one hands the model.
 *
 * Short and fixed-length by construction (D-015 only restricts *variable*-length text to
 * stdin/file) — safe as a CLI argument. Keep it short: every character here is paid on every
 * generation call, and D-011 already fights to keep the token floor down.
 *
 * The last two sentences (S4-T0e) close two gaps the original text left open. Both are D-025
 * ("absence of data doesn't become an assertion") stated to the model instead of enforced by
 * code — this task exists precisely because no unit test can enforce it on generated prose.
 * The original text only forbade inventing activity when there was nothing substantive at all;
 * it said nothing about the two failure shapes below, both of which happen *inside* real,
 * substantive activity:
 *
 * 1. Seeing that a category of things exists (e.g. paths under a worktree directory) without
 *    seeing which specific members it has, then filling in plausible-looking specific names to
 *    complete the category. The false specifics are what make the sentence read as verified.
 * 2. Reading a piece of evidence that got cut short (a truncated message, an unfinished search)
 *    and stating a definite conclusion from it — including the inverted one, which reads as a
 *    finished investigation and is harder to catch than an invented name because there is
 *    nothing to check it against.
 *
 * The last sentence (S4-T0i, D-033) makes deliberate what was previously accidental: the model
 * already mirrored the session's language before anyone asked it to, so the day it stops would
 * have looked like variation instead of an identifiable defect. It targets only the JSON field
 * values — the surrounding frame (keys, CLI text, summary.md headings) stays English per D-028
 * and is untouched by this instruction.
