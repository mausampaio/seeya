/**
 * The one place this adapter spawns a real process, through `adapters/process/spawn.ts#spawnHidden`
 * (D-038 — array arguments, `shell: false`, never `exec` with an interpolated string: the `cwd`s
 * this project runs in have spaces and accents; AGENTS.md § "Processos"). Everything else in
 * `adapters/generation` builds arguments and interprets output; this file is the only one that
 * touches a real process.
 *
 * **Hard timeout via `AbortSignal.timeout`, not `setTimeout` (D-019).** `setTimeout`/`setInterval`
 * are banned by name outside `adapters/clock/` (`eslint.config.js`'s `no-restricted-globals`) —
 * `AbortSignal.timeout(ms)` is a different global, resolves a bounded wait without this file ever
 * writing the literal identifier the guard watches for, and `child_process.spawn`'s own `signal`
 * option turns that into "kill the child and report why" for free, without this file reimplementing
 * a kill-after-deadline race by hand.
 *
 * **Stdin carries the prompt (D-015), never a CLI argument.** Confirmed for real (S2-T2, claude
 * 2.1.235): piping a file containing a newline, double and single quotes, `%`, and accented
 * Portuguese text through stdin with no positional prompt argument round-tripped byte-for-byte
 * through the model and back in `result` — this is the mechanism Spike C's mangled argument
 * should have used.
