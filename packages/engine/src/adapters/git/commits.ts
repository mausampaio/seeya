/**
 * "Commits do dia" (docs/ESPECIFICACAO.md § "Formato do handoff", `facts.git.commitsToday`).
 *
 * The filtering happens here, in TypeScript, against each commit's own committer timestamp — not
 * by handing `--since`/`--until` date words to git, because those are resolved against git's own
 * idea of "now" (the real system clock), not the `Clock` port this project injects everywhere
 * else (D-019). `--since=<cutoff>` below is only a coarse pre-filter, bounding how much history a
 * large repo has to walk; `cutoff` is itself derived from the injected `now`, one full day before
 * local midnight, wide enough to safely include every commit `isWithinLocalDay` will keep.
 *
 * Committer date (`%cI`, strict ISO-8601 with offset), not author date (`%aI`): a rebase or
 * cherry-pick can carry an old author date on a commit that was actually recorded today, and
 * "did work land today" is closer to what a handoff needs than "when was this change first
 * authored, possibly on another machine, possibly weeks ago". Not spelled out in
 * docs/ESPECIFICACAO.md — raised in docs/QUESTOES.md Q-017 and confirmed there for this reason.
