/**
 * Runs `git <args>` inside `workingDir` (array + `shell: false` — AGENTS.md § "Processos": never
 * build a command by string interpolation; `cwd` values in this project routinely carry spaces
 * and accents that a shell would mangle), through `adapters/process/spawn.ts#spawnHidden` (D-038).
 *
 * A separate, small implementation rather than reusing `adapters/process/spawn-stdout.ts`'s
 * `runForStdout`: that helper has no `cwd` option (its two callers, both in `proc-start.ts`, only
 * ever query the current process's own directory), and every command here needs one — for the
 * main `cwd` and, per worktree, for that worktree's own directory. Adding `cwd` there would touch
 * a file `adapters/process` owns for a caller `adapters/git` doesn't share.

/**
 * Discriminated on `ran`, not a bare exit code with a magic sentinel (D-024's reasoning applied
 * here too): `ran: false` is "this command never produced a real git exit code at all" — the
 * binary is missing, or `workingDir` doesn't exist to `chdir` into, or the process was killed by
 * a signal. That is a categorically different failure from `ran: true, exitCode: 128` (git ran
 * fine and reported, in its own normal way, e.g. "not a repository" or "no commits yet") — the two
 * callers in this adapter tell them apart on purpose: a real git exit code degrades gracefully to
 * "no data" (D-025), while `ran: false` for one *worktree* is what D-022 calls a rejectable item
 * (most commonly, `git worktree list` still remembering a directory that's gone from disk).
