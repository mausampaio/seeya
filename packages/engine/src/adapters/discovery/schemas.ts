/**
 * zod schemas for the two Claude Code structures that feed session discovery
 * (docs/ESPECIFICACAO.md § "Como as sessões são descobertas"; docs/DECISOES.md D-016).
 *
 * Neither is public Claude Code API — no field here is guaranteed by the vendor. That's why both
 * schemas follow the mandatory principle of docs/TESTES.md: **strict on the fields we use,
 * tolerant of unknown fields**. `z.object()` without `.strict()` already silently drops any
 * field outside the declared shape instead of failing — that's zod's default behavior and it's
 * exactly what's wanted here: confirmed on this machine that version 2.1.233 already writes
 * fields the original spec didn't foresee (`status`, `updatedAt`, `statusUpdatedAt`,
 * `bridgeSessionId`, `nameSource`, `nameSince`, `version`, `peerProtocol`) and parsing stays
 * intact.
 *
 * S0-T5's `esquemaSaidaAgentsJson` was `z.array(esquemaItemDeAgentsJson)` — tested against real
 * output from a second machine, Linux, a single entry (the background variant) took down the
 * whole array (D-022). `validarSaidaAgentsJson` replaces that schema with item-by-item
 * validation: no collection from an external source can be all-or-nothing.
 *
 * Both schemas were confirmed against real files and real output from two machines before being
 * written — see tests/contract/session-registry.test.ts and tests/contract/agents-json.test.ts.
 * If they ever diverge from reality, the answer is to log it in docs/QUESTOES.md with the raw
 * output observed, never to loosen the schema to make it pass.

/**
 * `~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json` — one file per process, alive or stale. The seven fields below
 * are cited literally by the spec and are the ones discovery uses, but not all of them fail the
 * record if missing — D-021 splits the fields into two groups:
 *
 * - **Identity and liveness, required**: `sessionId` and `cwd` (identify and locate the
 *   session), `pid` and `procStart` (liveness tie-break — PID recycled by the OS), `startedAt`.
 *   Without them there's no way to know which session this is nor whether it's alive — the
 *   session can't enter discovery.
 * - **Classification and display, optional**: `kind`, `entrypoint`, `name`. Cosmetic: without
 *   them the session is still identifiable and capturable, just not precisely
 *   classifiable/nameable. D-021 exists because the previous schema required all three and
 *   rejected the whole record if one was missing — crossed with a suppressed transcript
 *   (D-013), the session became totally invisible. The display defaults (`name` derived from
 *   `cwd`, `kind`/`entrypoint` as "unknown") are the S1-T3 adapter's responsibility, not this
 *   schema's.
 *
 * `kind` and `entrypoint` stay free-form strings, not an enum: only "interactive" and
 * "cli"/"claude-vscode" have been observed on this machine, but the spec already assumes other
 * values exist (`docs/DECISOES.md` D-016 talks about a headless session, which leaves no such
 * record; question Q-002 in docs/QUESTOES.md leaves open whether `kind` gets its own value for
 * it). Locking to a literal would break parsing the day that changes.
 *
 * `procStart` is a string, not a number: the real observed values (e.g. "134313811658518463")
 * exceed `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` — storing as a number would lose precision in exactly the
 * field used for tie-breaking.
 *
 * **`procStart` gets no format check beyond "non-empty" — do not add a `regex` back (Q-006,
 * docs/QUESTOES.md).** It used to be `.regex(/^\d+$/)`, which is right for Windows and Linux
 * (both give digits) and wrong for macOS: `docs/spikes/F-procstart-por-so.md` confirmed the
 * Claude Code binary reads it there from `ps -o lstart=`, a human-readable date like
 * `"Mon Aug 17 14:23:01 2026"`, not digits. That regex rejected every real macOS record, and
 * because validation here is item-by-item (D-022), the failure wasn't a crash — the session just
 * vanished from the list, silently, on the whole platform.
 *
 * This schema has no way to know which OS wrote the record it's reading, and that's exactly the
 * information a platform-specific check would need — codifying one platform's shape here means
 * rejecting another platform's legitimate record. The adapter that DOES know the shape is
 * `adapters/process`, which compares this stored value against a freshly observed one on the
 * machine it's running on right now (`core/classification.ts#pidRepresentsSameProcess`). A value
 * that adapter can't parse or compare degrades to `unavailable`, and by D-025 `unavailable` never
 * becomes `false` — so an unrecognized shape there is safe (liveness falls back to "alive", not
 * "gone"), while a `regex` here was unsafe (the whole session disappeared). Leave this as
 * `min(1)`; teach `adapters/process` about new shapes, never this schema.

 * on-disk record — mostly the same shape, but without `entrypoint`. `kind` and `name` follow the
 * same D-021 treatment: cosmetic, optional, never fail the item.
 *
 * There are **two shapes** of item, confirmed against real output from two machines (D-022):
 *
 * - **Interactive**: has `pid` and, only sometimes, `status` (observed: a "busy" session has
 *   `status`, an idle session doesn't have the field).
 * - **Background** (second machine, Linux — e.g. a session that brings up a UI and sits blocked
 *   waiting on its children): **has no `pid`**, uses `id` as the background session's
 *   identifier, and uses `state` instead of `status`.
 *
 * `pid` is optional here for a different reason than the rest of D-021's display group: it isn't
 * cosmetic, it's liveness — it's just that the background variant provides no PID at all, `id`
 * takes its place. **An item without `pid` is never a candidate for process termination
 * (D-002)**: there's no way to send a signal to a process with no PID, and `id` isn't a PID.
 * Whoever implements the termination policy (S1-T3 onward) needs to check `pid !== undefined`
 * before considering the item eligible — there's no other way to get the PID of a background item
 * from this source.
