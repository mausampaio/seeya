/**
 * POSIX (Linux/macOS) half of `ProcessControl.terminateGracefully` (D-002). See `termination.ts`
 * for the dispatcher and the general contract ("wait up to `deadlineMs`, report whether it
 * actually died, never a forced kill in v1").
 *
 * **Linux/macOS have a real answer: POSIX `SIGTERM`.** A process that installs a handler gets to
 * run it and save its own state before exiting; a process with no handler still gets the default
 * "terminate" action, which is what "graceful, with a deadline" means on these platforms.
 *
 * **POSIX-only by construction (S1-T12), the mirror of `console-signal.ts`'s Windows-only
 * exclusion.** `termination.ts`'s dispatcher never calls into this file when `process.platform ===
 * 'win32'`, so every line here is structurally unreachable on a Windows coverage run — not an
 * untested line, a line this platform cannot exercise. `vitest.config.ts` excludes this file from
 * Windows's coverage denominator for exactly that reason (`POSIX_ONLY_SOURCE`). On Linux/macOS
 * it's included and measured for real: `tests/integration/process/termination.test.ts`'s
 * `describe.skipIf(process.platform === 'win32')` block exercises it against a real child process.
