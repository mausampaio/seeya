 * S4-T3's "sobe desanexado" mechanism (D-005, emended 2026-08-18): re-runs this same `seeya`
 * binary as a detached, console-less child that outlives the shell that ran `seeya daemon`.
 *
 * **`detached: true` + `stdio: 'ignore'` + `.unref()` — all three, not a subset (D-005's own
 * text).** `detached` alone still leaves the child's stdio inherited from the parent's console on
 * Windows, which is enough to keep the child tied to that console's lifetime; `stdio: 'ignore'` is
 * what actually severs it (D-005: "no Windows isso significa console nenhum" —
 * `adapters/process/termination-windows.ts`'s own module comment measures the consequence:
 * `AttachConsole` fails on a process started this way, error 6, `docs/spikes/G-ctrl-break-no-windows.md`).
 * `.unref()` is what lets the LAUNCHER's own event loop drain and exit instead of waiting on a
 * child it will never `wait()` for.
 *
 * `spawn: shell: false` with an argument array throughout (AGENTS.md § "Processos") — the child's
 * own argv never passes through a shell that could mangle a `cwd` with spaces/accents, even though
 * this call has no `cwd`-shaped argument at all (only fixed script args), for the same reason the
 * project bans `exec` everywhere, not just where a variable happens to be dangerous today.

 * hide one option from `--help` while keeping the rest visible, and an env var already carries the

 * arriving asynchronously after this resolves (rare, and nothing left to do about it from here) is
 * not this function's problem to catch — the daemon's own lock file staying unwritten is what a
 * later `seeya daemon` invocation's liveness check would notice.
 *
 * `pid` can come back `undefined` per Node's own types (a spawn that fails asynchronously,
 * immediately after this call, before a PID was ever assigned) — treated as a spawn failure here
 * rather than handed to a caller that expects a real PID for the lock file (`core/daemon-lock.ts`).
