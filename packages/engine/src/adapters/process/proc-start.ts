/**
 * Captures the OS's current `procStart` for a PID — the value compared against the one recorded
 * at discovery time to break a recycled-PID tie (D-016, `core/classification.ts`).
 *
 * The three platforms don't just format the value differently, they get it from a different place
 * entirely (docs/spikes/F-procstart-por-so.md, independently confirmed — see the module-level
 * comments below for what was re-verified and how):
 *
 * | Platform | Source                              | Shape                              |
 * |----------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
 * | Linux    | `/proc/<pid>/stat`, field 22         | digits, ticks since boot            |
 * | macOS    | `ps -o lstart= -p <pid>`             | human-readable date, `LC_ALL=C`/`TZ=UTC` |
 * | Windows  | `(Get-Process -Id <pid>).StartTime`  | digits, Windows FILETIME (100ns since 1601) |
 *
 * The two "digits" shapes (Linux, Windows) are on completely different scales and never compare
 * across platforms — that's expected and fine, because `pidRepresentsSameProcess` only ever
 * compares two readings taken on the *same* machine.
 *
 * Every function here disambiguates a failure into `processGone` or `unavailable` (see
 * `ProcStartCapture` in `liveness.ts`) by re-running the same existence check `isAlive` already
 * uses, rather than trying to parse each OS command's specific error text (which is not a
 * contract any of these tools publish). If the PID is confirmed gone by that check, the earlier
 * failure was the race of the process dying between the liveness check and this read; if the PID
 * is still there, the failure is something else and D-025 applies — "unavailable", not "false".

 * the user's PowerShell profile on every liveness check.
 *
 * **Why `run` is a parameter, not a direct call to `runForStdout` (S4-T0f, Q-047).** Measured on a

 * a unit test asserting the `processGone`/`unavailable` labeling below can't launch this for real.
 * `run` defaults to the real `runForStdout` here and in `captureObservedProcStart`; only a test
 * substitutes a fake, the same shape `WindowsToastBackend` (`adapters/notification/windows-toast.ts`)
