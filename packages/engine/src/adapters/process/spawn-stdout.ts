 * an interpolated string), returning trimmed stdout on a zero exit code, or `undefined` on any
 * failure (spawn error, non-zero exit). Extracted out of `proc-start.ts` (macOS/Windows
 * `procStart`), which still uses it, instead of that module carrying it inline.
 *
 * **Also used by `inspection.ts` (macOS `cwd`/command line) between S1-T10 and S1-T11 — removed
 * with that module in S1-T11 (D-029).** Kept here on its own, unchanged: `proc-start.ts` is still
 * a live caller, so this file stays despite losing its second one (docs/PLANO-DE-ENTREGA.md
 * S1-T11's own warning not to delete it along with `inspection.ts`).
