/**
 * Sends `CTRL_BREAK_EVENT` to a Windows console by PID, and waits for a process to leave it, both
 * via a PowerShell helper (P/Invoke into `kernel32.dll`) — no native dependency, same technique
 * `adapters/notification/` already uses for the WinRT toast (docs/spikes/B-notificacoes.md).
 * `src/adapters/process/termination-windows.ts` is the only caller (split out of `termination.ts`
 * in S1-T12); see that file's module comment for what this technique proves and doesn't prove
 * (docs/spikes/G-ctrl-break-no-windows.md).
 *
 * **Why the script is a template literal sent through `-EncodedCommand`, not a `.ps1` file on
 * disk or a `-Command` string.** Two alternatives were considered:
 *
 * - A `.ps1` file in the package needs `tsc`'s build to actually copy it into `dist/` (it won't,
 *   on its own — `tsconfig.build.json` only compiles `.ts`) and a resolved path that survives
 *   being installed from npm, not just run from source. That's two new ways to break silently
 *   after `npm run build` that a `-Command` string doesn't have.
 * - A `-Command <string>` embedded directly needs the script to survive re-quoting once as a
 *   `spawn` argument and, because PowerShell re-parses `-Command`'s value itself, a second time
 *   internally. That is genuinely fragile: building the spike this technique came from, `$_` got
 *   silently swallowed and a backtick was read as command substitution — twice — before the
 *   command worked (docs/spikes/G-ctrl-break-no-windows.md).
 *
 * `-EncodedCommand` sidesteps both: the script text below is never re-parsed as a command line at
 * all, only base64-decoded and run, so nothing in it needs shell-style escaping — and it lives in
 * this file, which `tsc` already compiles into `dist/` like everything else, so there's no second
 * asset to lose track of after a build. The only characters this file has to get right are
 * PowerShell's own (backtick, `@'...'@`), never `cmd.exe`'s or `spawn`'s.

 * whether the *target* died. `sendCtrlBreak`'s outcome is fully decided the moment the word lands
