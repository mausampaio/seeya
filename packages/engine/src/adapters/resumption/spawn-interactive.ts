 * **`stdio: 'inherit'`, never `'pipe'` — the load-bearing fact of this whole adapter.**
 * docs/spikes/H-retomada-interativa.md measured that a piped `claude --resume` (no real terminal
 * attached) detects the absence of a TTY and silently degrades: it answers once, in plain text,
 * and exits — never opening an actual interactive session. Handing the child the real terminal
 * (the same one `seeya` itself is running in) is the only way measured to get a genuine,
 * continuable session. The direct consequence: this module never sees the child's stdout or
 * stderr — they go straight to the same screen the user is already looking at — so it can only
 * ever report an exit code, never a message.
