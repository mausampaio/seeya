 * `Storage` (not just the ones this particular `endDay` run just captured) so the briefing stays
 * consolidated across multiple runs the same day, e.g. `seeya end-day --session <id>` (S2-T5) run
 * more than once. The actual rendering is `core/briefing.ts#generateBriefingMarkdown`, a pure
 * function; this module is the thin I/O shell around it (`application/` orchestrates, `core/`
 * decides what the text says).

/**
 * Reads back every handoff saved for `day`, renders the consolidated markdown, and persists it as
 * `~/.seeya/days/<day>/summary.md`. Never throws over a corrupted individual handoff file (D-022:
 * `Storage#listHandoffs` already isolates that per file) — only a failure of the listing or the
 * write itself propagates, same as any other storage I/O in this use case.
 *
 * `listedSessions` (D-031) is THIS run's own fresh discovery, not persisted anywhere: unlike
 * handoffs, a listed session was never captured, so there is nothing for `Storage` to have on disk
 * for a previous run to merge back in — the section simply reflects who was out of scope as of the
 * most recent `seeya end-day` run, the same way `seeya sessions` would if run again right now.
 *
 * `scope` (S4-T0c, discard counts added by S4-T0d) is THIS call's own `ResolvedEndDayScope`, passed
 * straight through to `generateBriefingMarkdown` — same "not persisted, always the latest run's own
 * view" reasoning as `listedSessions` just above, not derived from `handoffs` (which can span
 * several earlier runs).
 *
 * @example
 * await writeDailyBriefing(deps.storage, day, now, listedSessions, scope);
