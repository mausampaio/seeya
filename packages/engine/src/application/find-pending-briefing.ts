/**
 * `seeya start-day`'s step 1 (docs/ESPECIFICACAO.md § `seeya start-day`): "Lê o briefing mais
 * recente que ainda tem pendências." Walks backward one local calendar day at a time from
 * `clock.now()` (D-019: the instant comes from the injected `Clock`, never read here), stopping
 * at the first day whose `Briefing` (`Storage.readBriefing`, S3-T1) has at least one handoff
 * `core/pending-briefing.ts#briefingStillPending` calls pending — that check weighs both content
 * AND `Storage.readResumedSessionIds(day)` (S3-T3); see that module's own docstring for the full
 * rule and why it's per session, not per day.
 *
 * **No product-level age cutoff (docs/QUESTOES.md Q-026, revised on review).** An earlier version
 * of this module refused to look back more than a week, reasoning by analogy with
 * `Config.forkCleanupDays`. That analogy doesn't hold: `forkCleanupDays` protects a case where
 * erring toward "too long" costs disk, and erring toward "too short" costs nothing but a stale
 * file. Here, refusing an old-but-still-pending briefing costs the one thing `seeya start-day`
 * exists to hand back — "where was I" for someone who was away two weeks, on vacation or heads
 * down on something else. If it's worth resuming old work, that is the user's call, not this
 * function's. So there is no age past which a real pending briefing stops counting; the caller
 * gets `daysAgo` (how many local days back it was found) and can show that plainly, e.g.
 * "this plan is from 3 weeks ago", and decide.
 *
 * `MAX_BRIEFING_SCAN_DAYS` below is a **disk-I/O bound, not a product judgment** — see its own
 * docstring.

/**
 * The **default** for `Config.maxBriefingScanDays` (`core/types.ts`) — how many days back
 * `findPendingBriefing` will call `Storage.readBriefing` looking for a pending day, before giving
 * up. **This was never a claim about how old a briefing may be to still count as pending, only a
 * limit on how much disk this function is willing to touch in one call.** Raising this number
 * doesn't change what "pending" means (`core/pending-briefing.ts` decides that on its own, by
 * content); it only changes how far back this function is willing to search for one. Picked
 * generously (30 days, a bit over a typical vacation plus slack) precisely because it was never the
 * thing doing the judging — the content check is. If a real pending briefing sits further back than
 * this, `findPendingBriefing` won't find it and reports `found: false`; that's this function's own
 * honest limit (D-025: it doesn't claim "no pending briefing exists", only "none was found within
 * the days scanned" — see `daysSearched` on the `found: false` case).
 *
 * **D-035 moved this from a hardcoded constant to a config field** — docs/QUESTOES.md Q-025 had
 * labeled it an I/O bound, and D-035 corrected that: how far back someone wants "where was I" to
 * reach depends on how long THEY were away, which is preference, not a disk-cost fact. Still
 * exported and still the fallback `findPendingBriefing` uses below when a caller doesn't pass
 * `maxScanDays` explicitly.

/**
 * `findPendingBriefing`'s result — a discriminated union (D-024), not `Briefing | null`, so a
 * caller can tell "found nothing" from "found nothing, and here's how far back it looked" without
 * inventing a sentinel `Briefing`. `daysSearched` lets `seeya start-day` (S3-T3) say something
 * honest ("no pending briefing in the last 31 days scanned") instead of a bare "nothing found"
 * (D-025) — acceptance criterion "nenhum briefing pendente é caso normal, não erro" lands here as
 * a value, never a thrown error.
 *
 * `daysAgo` on the `found: true` case is how many local calendar days back the briefing sits
 * relative to `clock.now()` (`0` = today, `1` = yesterday, …) — the raw number `seeya start-day`
 * needs to tell the user plainly when the plan they're about to see is NOT from yesterday (Q-026).
 *
 * `resumedSessionIds` is the same set this function already read to decide the day counts as
 * pending — handed back so `seeya start-day` (S3-T3) doesn't read it a second time to build the
 * resumable candidate list (`core/pending-briefing.ts#unresumedHandoffs`).
