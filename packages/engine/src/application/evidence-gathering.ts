/**
 * D-013's multi-source collection, for one session: calls `TranscriptReader`/`GitReader`, merges
 * what they answer into `HandoffFacts`, and decides `sources[]` — which of the three evidence
 * sources actually contributed. A source that throws is treated the same as a source with nothing
 * to say (D-025's "absence of data" applied to a failure, not just a gap): failing to read git or
 * the transcript for ONE session must never take the whole capture down, and it must never take
 * down the OTHER source for the same session either (docs/PLANO-DE-ENTREGA.md S2-T3: "coleta
 * multi-fonte... handoff válido com qualquer fonte respondendo").
 *
 * **Where this guard-rail ends.** A thrown error here is swallowed with no record of WHY that
 * source didn't answer — there's no field in `Handoff` (docs/ESPECIFICACAO.md § "Formato do
 * handoff") to carry a per-source failure reason, only whether it answered at all. This covers the
 * ordinary case (permission denied, file vanished mid-read) silently degrading to "didn't
 * respond"; it doesn't diagnose *why* for someone reading the handoff later. AGENTS.md's "ainda
 * não existe logger" is why this isn't logged either — see docs/QUESTOES.md for this gap flagged
 * for the PO.
