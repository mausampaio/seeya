/**
 * The per-session pipeline `endDay` runs under its concurrency limit, for one session that has
 * already passed the cheap eligibility stage (`eligibility-assembly.ts`): gather evidence, decide
 * D-026's anti-duplication for real, generate understanding, assemble and persist the handoff, and
 * — only once that's verified on disk — terminate the process if the session opted in (D-002).
 *
 * Every I/O step here can throw; `endDay` (`end-day.ts`) wraps a call to `captureSession` in its
 * own try/catch so one session's failure is isolated (docs/PLANO-DE-ENTREGA.md S2-T3), which is
 * why this module lets exceptions propagate instead of catching them itself — swallowing here
 * would just move the isolation boundary to the wrong layer.
