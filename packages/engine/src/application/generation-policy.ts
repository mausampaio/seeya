 *
 * **`"noTranscript"` is not produced by this function today.** It exists in `HandoffSource` for

 * `deps.deepGenerator` at all; this is what a session whose policy calls for deep capture reports
 * instead.

 * "missing transcript", not "dry-run policy" — reusing it here would misname the reason a reader
 * sees in a session that DOES have a transcript. `generationError` says in plain words that this
 * is a skip, not a failure, so nobody reads it as the model having actually been tried and failed
