 * optional so every existing call site (unit tests, S2-T3's own acceptance) keeps compiling
 * unchanged with the real, full-day, real-write behavior it always had.
 *
 * `sessionFilter` is a plain predicate over `DiscoveredSession`, not a `sessionId`/`cwd` pair —
 * `endDay` still runs `SessionProvider.list()` itself and only narrows what it processes
 * afterward, so `application/` never needs to know `--session` accepts either an id or a `cwd`
 * (`cli/`'s job, `end-day-command.ts`) or grow a special case for two different matching rules.
 *
 * `scope` (S4-T0c) is independent of `sessionFilter` on purpose, not derived from whether it's
 * set: `sessionFilter` is an arbitrary predicate (several existing unit tests pass one without
 * exercising the `--session` feature at all — `() => false`, matching by an unrelated field), and
 * inferring "this run was narrowed" from "a predicate was passed" would make an unrelated test's
 * fixture silently start claiming a `--session`-narrowed scope it never meant to declare. `cli/`
 * (the only real production caller of a narrowed run) sets both together, consistently, from the
 * same resolved session. Optional here, unlike `core/types.ts#ResolvedEndDayScope` (never
 * optional): this is `endDay`'s own INPUT, and the ordinary "no `--session` at all" case reads
 * exactly like `dryRun`/`sessionFilter`'s own optionality above — absence here means "use the
 * full-day default", resolved inside `endDay` into a concrete, always-present
 * `ResolvedEndDayScope` (S4-T0d adds its discard counts) before it ever reaches
 * `core/briefing.ts`, which is where that type's own "never let absence mean one of the two
