/**
 * One daemon poll cycle (docs/ESPECIFICACAO.md § "Comportamento do daemon": "loop de verificação a
 * cada 30 s"). `scheduler/loop.ts` calls this repeatedly, sleeping between calls via `Clock.sleep`
 * (D-019) — this file has no timer of its own, and no memory of its own either: every poll re-reads
 * `Config`/`DayState` from `Storage` (D-006: `estado.json` is "persistido, não guardado em
 * memória", so a concurrent `seeya snooze`/`skip-today` is visible on the very next poll).
 *
 * **The active-turn retry (docs/ESPECIFICACAO.md: up to 5 minutes) falls out of the SAME 30s poll
 * loop, not a second one.** `core/schedule.ts#decideSchedule`'s own contract is explicit that its
 * `nextState` is only a proposal — "the caller only carries this forward after acting on decision
 * succeeds". This file takes that literally for `endOfDay`: while any just-captured session is
 * still `capturedDuringActiveTurn`, it persists everything EXCEPT `endOfDayFired`, so the very next
 * 30s poll sees the SAME undecided day, asks `decideSchedule` again, and gets `endOfDay` again —
 * `application/endDay` naturally skips anything already captured cleanly (D-026's anti-duplication)
 * and only really re-attempts what's still active. `Spike J` is why this doesn't need a tighter
 * loop of its own: the daemon-relevant cache tier is ~1h, so 30s-grained polling was already the
 * chosen cadence for the whole design, not a workaround invented here.

 * `overdue` reuses the SAME `decision.delayMs` `buildDaemonEndOfDayNotice` already renders — it is
 * deliberately NOT recomputed from a fresh `now` at the moment of the actual capture, a few
 * milliseconds later, because `delayMs` is already "how far past the deadline was THIS decision",
 * and this run is acting on that one decision.

 * **A run that finalizes only because the active-turn retry budget expired (`budgetExpired` below)
 * is also `overdue` under the DEFAULT config, and this is accepted, not overlooked** —
 * `ACTIVE_TURN_RETRY_BUDGET_MS` (5 min) and `Config.overdueFireThresholdMinutes`'s own default (5
 * min) share their value on purpose (docs/QUESTOES.md Q-049 item 5 already made this same call for
 * the notice-only version of this threshold: "o mesmo número da janela de turno ativo, de
 * propósito, não coincidência"). This file has no way to tell "genuinely woke up from suspension"
 * apart from "spent the whole retry window mid-turn" — both show up as the same growing `delayMs`
 * across consecutive 30s polls — and D-036's own reasoning ("quando em dúvida, não encerre") argues
 * for treating them the same rather than inventing a way to tell them apart. Flagged in
 * docs/QUESTOES.md Q-054 for confirmation, since it's a real, if narrow, behavior change: a session
 * that stays active right up to the end-of-day deadline no longer gets terminated on the poll that
 * finally closes it, even with `canTerminate: true`, whenever it also took the full retry budget to
