/**
 * Contract test for `--append-system-prompt-file` (S3-T4, docs/PLANO-DE-ENTREGA.md).
 *
 * D-004's resumption fallback (`adapters/resumption/args.ts#buildFallbackArgs`) hands the
 * previous day's plan to a fresh session via `--append-system-prompt-file` instead of
 * `--system-prompt-file` specifically because the first is supposed to ADD to Claude Code's own
 * default system prompt, while the second REPLACES it outright (Q-027 item 3). Neither flag has
 * its own entry in `claude --help` — confirmed again on this machine (claude 2.1.251): only the
 * inline `--append-system-prompt <prompt>` / `--system-prompt <prompt>` pair get a documented
 * entry; the `-file` variants surface only as a parenthetical, `--append-system-prompt[-file]`,
 * inside `--bare`'s description. That is strictly weaker than "documented" — there is still no
 * description of what the `-file` variant does on its own, so the semantics this test checks
 * remain something `seeya` measured, not something the vendor promised.
 *
 * **What this test can and cannot prove, stated up front (see also Q-029).** It proves the
 * append-vs-replace distinction the way the task asked: by asking the model, in the SAME turn, one
 * thing only the default Claude Code system prompt would answer (the product name it is running
 * inside) and one thing only the appended file says (a synthetic marker token). If replace ever
 * happened instead of append, the file's content would still reach the model (the marker still
 * comes back) but the product-name question would stop resolving to Claude Code — because nothing
 * in `seeya`'s own appended file mentions any CLI product name. That asymmetry is what makes the
 * two flags distinguishable from outside the process, without reading any Claude Code source.
 *
 * **This is a claim about what replace does, and a review of the first version of this file
 * caught that the claim was never actually measured — only assumed from how the flags are named.**
 * "Both facts arrive" is compatible with EITHER semantics unless something demonstrates that
 * replacing the prompt really does blank out the product-name answer; without that, a pass here
 * wouldn't discriminate anything, which is exactly the decorative-test failure mode CLAUDE.md § "O
 * erro clássico neste projeto" warns about. The third call below (`--system-prompt-file`, the
 * flag that DOES replace) closes that gap: measured on claude 2.1.251, it returns
 * `{"tool":"UNKNOWN","secretToken":"SEEYA-CONTRACT-K7QF2"}` — the marker still arrives, but the
 * product name does not. That is the missing negative control: it proves the observable actually
 * discriminates between the two semantics, instead of merely being consistent with the one this
 * file hopes is true. See Q-029 for the raw output.
 *
 * **Invocation count: exactly 3 real `claude -p` calls per run, all in `beforeAll`, never
 * retried.** One baseline (no flag at all) establishes that the product-name question actually
 * resolves to Claude Code under this flag's absence — without that control, an "unknown" result
 * from the real case would be ambiguous between "the flag replaced the default" and "this
 * model/prompt phrasing just doesn't answer that question reliably" (Q-029 documents exactly this
 * ambiguity biting the first version of the prompt). The second call is `--append-system-prompt-file`,
 * the real case under test. **The third is the negative control** described above
 * (`--system-prompt-file`, same context file, same prompt, same schema) — without it, the second
 * call passing would be compatible with replace ALSO preserving the product name for some
 * unrelated reason (general model knowledge, another environment signal) — which is EXACTLY what
 * measurement found `--model sonnet` doing (see the comment above `PROMPT`: sonnet answered
 * "Claude Code" even under a full replace, and separately blew the budget ceiling below via an
 * internal routing call). All three calls use `--model haiku`, the only configuration measured to
 * actually discriminate, `--no-session-persistence` and a hard `--max-budget-usd` ceiling, and all
 * three ask for a short structured-JSON reply (two short strings) to keep output tokens minimal.
 * `cwd` is a disposable `mkdtemp` folder, never a real project; the environment is sanitized the
 * same way `adapters/generation` sanitizes it for its own real calls (D-017), reusing that
 * adapter's own pure function instead of re-declaring the variable list here.
 *
 * Doesn't run in standard CI — only via `npm run test:contrato`, same as the rest of this
 * directory (docs/TESTES.md § Contrato).

/**
 * Three configurations tried, all measured against the real binary, kept here instead of silently
 * swapping wording or model (AGENTS.md § "Preserve os comentários existentes" in spirit) — each is
 * exactly the kind of measurement that justifies this file's design, and losing them would let
 * someone redo a failed attempt in six months, or worse, pick the one that looks cheapest without
 * knowing it silently proves nothing.
 *
 * **v1** asked a yes/no "do you know your own identity" question (`identityKnown: boolean`,
 * `--model haiku`). Came back `false` even in the baseline call with NO flag at all — a
 * refusal-shaped answer to a meta-question about its own instructions, not evidence the identity
 * fact itself is absent.
 *
 * **v2 (current): asks the model to just STATE the product name** instead of asserting a claim
 * about its own knowledge, `--model haiku`. The append vs. replace comparison itself has been
 * measured twice this way (once as a standalone probe before the negative-control arm was wired
 * into this file, once as this file's own three-call `beforeAll`), and BOTH times: the append call
 * returned "Claude Code" and the replace call returned `UNKNOWN` — the discrimination this file
 * exists to prove held on every comparison run. The ONE exception, across all measurements: a bare
 * no-flag baseline call, on its own, once returned `UNKNOWN` too (same prompt, same model,
 * different sample, in the second run). See the control test's own failure message below for what
 * that specific, measured flake rate means for reading a red baseline in isolation.
 *
 * **v3, tried and REJECTED: `--model sonnet`**, hoping a larger model would answer the identity
 * question more consistently than haiku's occasional refusal. Measured, once, against all three
 * calls: (a) cost exploded to ~$0.13/call — well past the `$0.10` ceiling below, triggering
 * `error_max_budget_usd` on two of the three calls — because `--model sonnet` here silently
 * routes through an internal haiku classifier call before the real sonnet turn (visible in the
 * raw `modelUsage` object: both `claude-haiku-4-5-*` and `claude-sonnet-5` billed in the SAME
 * invocation), each paying a large fresh `cache_creation_input_tokens` charge under
 * `--no-session-persistence`. (b) Far more importantly: **the one sonnet call that DID complete —
 * the replace case — answered `"Claude Code"` anyway**, even with the default system prompt fully
 * replaced by a file that never mentions any CLI product. That means sonnet's self-report does
 * NOT depend on the system prompt at all (general training knowledge or some other environment
 * signal answers it regardless) — the observable this whole file relies on stops discriminating
 * completely under this model. `sonnet` is disqualified for BOTH reasons independently; reverted
 * to `haiku` (v2), the only configuration measured to actually discriminate. This is exactly the
 * "stop and report instead of continuing to iterate" case: the finding is now in Q-029 rather than
 * chased through more real invocations.
