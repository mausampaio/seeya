/**
 * docs/TESTES.md § Contrato, item 4: "`claude agents --json` still returns an array with `pid`,
 * `sessionId`, `cwd`." Local command (D-016) — enumerates processes already running on the
 * machine, doesn't touch the network. Doesn't run in standard CI — only via `npm run
 * test:contrato`.
 *
 * `validateAgentsJsonOutput` is item-by-item (D-022) — but D-022's tolerance is for the
 * **product**: the user's `seeya sessoes` can't go down because of a strange entry, so the
 * adapter discards the bad item and moves on. **This test has the opposite purpose**: it exists
 * to scream when reality diverges from the schema, because the contract suite doesn't run in CI
 * (only via `npm run test:contrato`) and a failure here is the only signal a human has to go
 * investigate. If we applied the same tolerance here, a new variant would be silently discarded
 * and nobody would know — the alarm would turn into a shock absorber, and "green contract" would
 * stop proving what it claims to prove. That's why `rejected` needs to be **empty**, not just
 * `accepted` greater than zero: any item the schema doesn't recognize fails the test, with the
 * item's raw JSON in the message.
