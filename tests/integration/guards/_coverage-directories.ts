/**
 * Independent declaration of docs/TESTES.md's per-directory coverage floor (`core/` 95%, every
 * other production directory 80%) — the S1-T12 counterpart to `_layer-matrix.ts` (S0-T6) and
 * `_test-projects.ts` (S1-T0e), same philosophy applied to a third config file.
 *
 * S1-T12 found that vitest.config.ts's `coverage.thresholds` keyed `'src/**'` for "every other
 * directory" — a glob that matches every file under `src/`, not the complement of `src/core/**`.
 * Measured: it computed the SAME number as the unscoped aggregate (91.7% the day this was
 * found), so a directory sitting well below 80% (`adapters/process`, 78.19%) passed anyway. The
 * fix is one glob PER production directory (vitest.config.ts's `PRODUCTION_DIRECTORY_THRESHOLDS`)
 * — but a literal, hand-written list of glob keys has the exact same blind spot `_test-projects.ts`
 * already named for the vitest project list: a directory added to `src/` after that object was
 * written gets no glob, no threshold, no protection, and nothing says so.
 *
 * `coverage-directories.test.ts` closes that gap the same way `test-projects.test.ts` does for
 * vitest's projects: it compares this list against the REAL `src/` tree, and against
 * vitest.config.ts's REAL `coverage.thresholds` keys, in both directions — never deriving one
 * from the other. A directory that exists in `src/` but not here fails loudly instead of coasting
 * on whatever glob happens to also match it.

 *
 * `packages/cli/src` is `covered` at 80% since S1-T6 (`cli` in the pre-monorepo layout), not
 * `excluded` — the directory grew past its single wiring file the moment `sessions`/`status`
 * needed a composition root, view-model assembly and text formatting of their own. It is declared
 * as ONE entry covering the whole package (unlike engine's per-layer entries below) because,
 * unlike `packages/engine/src`, it has no further subdirectory of its own — `index.ts` and every
 * other cli file sit directly in `packages/cli/src`. Only `index.ts` itself stays out of
 * `coverage.include` in vitest.config.ts (thin `commander` wiring, exercised for real only by the
 * compiled e2e journey, docs/TESTES.md nº1) — every other file is real branching logic and
 * carries the same floor every other adapter directory does.
