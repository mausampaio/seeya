 * Single source of truth for the layer matrix in docs/ARQUITETURA.md — 5 layers, 20 ordered

 * driven by this structure: none of the 20 pairs is a hand-written `it(...)`.
 *
 * This is a second source of truth, independent of `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` — on purpose. The
 * point of the "guard of the guard" is to confirm the tool's real behavior matches the doc's
 * table; if this file just repeated `.dependency-cruiser.cjs`'s rules, an error made in both
 * places at once would slip through.
 *
 * Not a test file (doesn't end in `.test.ts`), just the data structure + pure functions that
 * derive the pairs from it.
