 * CPU contention from the other guard files running in parallel: 6246, 6676, 8808, 9834, 11618,
 * 11872ms. One of those runs, still under the OLD 20_000ms combined budget, reproduced the exact
 * bug this task fixes: vitest reported "Test timed out in 20000ms" for a test whose own elapsed
 * counter read 22239ms — the child was never hung, just unlucky under load, and the old design
 * destroyed that distinction. `30_000` keeps ~2.5x margin over the clean worst case (11872ms)

 * directly, without tolerating this, and the PO reproduced the suite (not the test — the SUITE)
 * crashing with `ENOENT: ... scandir`. The TOCTOU hadn't been eliminated from dependency-cruiser:
 * it had been MOVED one level up, to this scan. E.g. the test "doesn't reject
 * src/application-legacy/ by mistake" (dependency-cruiser.test.ts) creates `src/application-legacy/`

 * and sees `application-legacy` in time, but only gets to read its CONTENTS after that `finally` has
 * already run, the recursive `readdirSync` in here blows up.
 *
 * Why tolerating this is the CORRECT answer and not a lazy `catch` hiding instability (the same
 * trap as the retry we already discarded): the only kind of directory that can vanish mid-scan is
 * a transient artifact from another guard test file — either a `_guard-*` (which we already skip
 * by name anyway) or a whole synthetic layer like `application-legacy/`, created and deleted by a
 * single test. No real PRODUCTION directory is ever deleted during the suite. So "disappeared
 * between me listing the parent and me trying to read it" is, by definition, "not production" —
 * returning an empty list for that branch is the semantically correct read, not fault tolerance.
 *
 * That's why the `catch` checks the error's `code`: only ENOENT becomes an empty list. Any other

 * has to scream, not pretend everything's fine.

 * S1-T0, this function's history: the first version passed the `src` DIRECTORY to

 * TOCTOU described in `runDependencyCruiser`. The fix tested first was retrying up to 3 times
