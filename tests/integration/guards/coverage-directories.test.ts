/**
 * Closes S1-T12: vitest.config.ts's `coverage.thresholds` used to key `'src/**'` for "every
 * directory except core/" — a glob that matches every instrumented file, so it computed the same
 * number as the unscoped aggregate. Measured the day this was found: `adapters/process` sat at
 * 78.19%, below its own 80% floor, while `'src/**'` read 91.7% (the aggregate, carried by
 * everything else) and the gate passed. The fix, in vitest.config.ts, is one glob key per
 * production directory. This file is what keeps that list honest, the same way
 * `test-projects.test.ts` (S1-T0e) keeps vitest's project list honest and `layer-matrix.test.ts`
 * (S0-T6) keeps the layer matrix honest — same shape of gap, third config file.
 *
 * `_coverage-directories.ts` declares, independently of vitest.config.ts, which directories carry
 * a coverage floor and what it is. This file enforces that declaration against reality, in every
 * direction:
 *
 * 1. every directory `src/` really has (scanned from disk, not read out of any config) is
 *    declared here, either `covered` or `excluded-with-reason` — a real directory nobody declared
 *    would otherwise get zero floor and nothing would say so;
 * 2. the SET of `covered` directories here matches the set of glob keys vitest.config.ts's
 *    `coverage.thresholds` really has — a key added or removed there without a matching edit here
 *    fails loudly instead of running unchecked;
 * 3. the threshold NUMBER declared here for each directory matches the number really configured
 *    — so quietly lowering one directory's floor in vitest.config.ts (without this file agreeing
 *    it should be lower) is visible as a test failure, not a silent pass.

/**
 * The two package src roots' real leaf directories that directly hold at least one production
 * `.ts` file, as project-root-relative paths (e.g. `'packages/engine/src/adapters/process'`) —
 * V2-T1's replacement for the old single `src/`-relative scan. Built from `listProductionTsFiles`
 * (S1-T0, reused here per S1-T12 rather than a second recursive walker) so this inherits the same
 * TOCTOU-safe scan and `_guard-*` exclusion the dependency-cruiser guards already rely on — a
 * guard fixture writing into `packages/engine/src/adapters/clock/_guard-eslint/` mid-run must
 * never be read as a new production directory here.
 *
 * The two roots are scanned differently on purpose: `packages/engine/src` still requires every
 * production file to live one layer directory deep (core/, adapters/<x>/, application/,
 * scheduler/ — same as the pre-monorepo `src/` did), so a stray top-level file still throws.
 * `packages/cli/src` has no such subdirectory at all (cli's files sit directly in its own package
 * root) — it either holds at least one production file, in which case it's ONE covered unit
 * (`'packages/cli/src'` itself, matching `_coverage-directories.ts`'s single entry for it and
 * vitest.config.ts's one glob key for the whole package), or it holds none.
