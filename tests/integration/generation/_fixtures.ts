/**
 * Puts a fake `claude` on disk, backed by `tests/fixtures/generation/fake-claude.mjs`
 * (docs/TESTES.md § `generation/`). `createFakeClaudeFixture()` returns an absolute
 * `binaryPath` — pass it as `claudeBinary` to `LeanHandoffGenerator`/`DeepHandoffGenerator`
 * rather than relying on `PATH` search (measured on this machine: prepending to `PATH` let
 * Windows' extension search resolve the REAL `claude.exe` installed elsewhere on `PATH` ahead of
 * this fixture, since `.EXE` outranks `.CMD` in `PATHEXT` regardless of directory order).
 *
 * **Windows needs a real compiled `.exe`, not a `.cmd`/`.bat` launcher.** Measured on this
 * machine (Node 22.19, S2-T2): `spawn(cmdPath, args, {shell:false})` throws a SYNCHRONOUS
 * `EINVAL` for any `.cmd`/`.bat` target — Node's fix for CVE-2024-27980 (batch-file argument
 * injection) refuses to launch one at all unless `shell:true`, which production's
 * `spawn-claude.ts` never sets (correctly: the real `claude` is a native `.exe`, D-015's
 * `shell:false` is exactly right there). A `.cmd` wrapper would make this test harness lie about
 * what production actually does, not just fail to compile. The fix here is test-only: compile a
 * tiny native passthrough launcher with the C# compiler every Windows machine ships as part of
 * the .NET Framework runtime (`csc.exe` — present without a Visual Studio/SDK install), which
 * just re-execs `node <fake-claude.mjs> <args...>` inheriting stdio, so the exact same
 * `shell:false` code path production uses is what every generation test also exercises.
