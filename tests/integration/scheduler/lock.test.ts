/**
 * `scheduler/lock.ts` wired to the REAL `adapters/process` (S4-T3b) — the recycled-PID tie-break
 * and the "no recorded procStart" fallback can't be proven with a fake `ProcessControl`, because a
 * fake doesn't implement the tie-break at all (see `tests/unit/scheduler/_fakes.ts`'s own
 * `ControllableProcessControl` docstring). This is exactly the "não acontece sozinho, precisa ser
 * construído" case docs/PLANO-DE-ENTREGA.md S4-T3b calls out.
 *
 * Reuses the same technique `tests/integration/process/liveness.test.ts` already established: a
 * real spawned child stands in for "the process the lock currently points at", and a deliberately
 * wrong `procStart` string stands in for a PID the OS recycled onto an unrelated process — the
 * PID really is alive (real OS state), but the CURRENT `procStart` genuinely disagrees with what
 * was recorded, exactly the shape a recycled PID produces. Forcing an ACTUAL OS-level PID reuse
 * portably in a test isn't possible; this reproduces the same observable evidence
 * `resolveIsAlive`'s comparison ever sees, which is what it's judged on either way.
