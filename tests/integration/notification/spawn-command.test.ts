/**
 * `spawnCommand` (`adapters/notification/backend.ts`) against a REAL process — the one piece of
 * this adapter every backend's own test replaces with `RecordingCommandRunner`
 * (`tests/unit/adapters/notification/_command-runner-fakes.ts`), on purpose, to keep `npm test`
 * from ever popping a real OS notification. This file proves the generic spawn plumbing itself
 * (argument array, `shell: false`, stdout/stderr capture, exit code) still works, using the
 * current Node binary — always present, harmless, and produces no visible side effect at all —
 * rather than any real notification command.
