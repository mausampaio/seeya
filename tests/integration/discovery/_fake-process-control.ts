/**
 * Named double for `ProcessControl` (docs/TESTES.md § Testes: "duplo de I/O é classe/objeto
 * nomeado implementando a porta, não stub inline"). Liveness is a fixed map keyed by `pid`,
 * supplied by the test. Real process liveness is `adapters/process`'s own suite
 * (tests/integration/process/); this one is about the discovery adapters' file/JSON handling and
 * field mapping, so faking the port out keeps it independent of any real OS process.
 *
 * **Briefly (S1-T10 to S1-T11) also faked `readCwd`/`readCommandLine`, with two more constructor
 * maps, for the `.key`-without-`.json` discovery strategy (D-023).** Removed along with that
 * strategy and the two `ProcessControl` methods it needed — see docs/DECISOES.md D-029.
