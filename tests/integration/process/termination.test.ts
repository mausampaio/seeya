/**
 * `processControl.terminateGracefully` against a real child process

 *
 * The two `describe.skipIf` blocks below are not symmetric on purpose. On POSIX this proves
 * gracefulness happened (the child's own SIGTERM handler ran to completion). On Windows it now
 * proves the same thing, by a different mechanism (`CTRL_BREAK_EVENT` via a PowerShell helper,
 * docs/spikes/G-ctrl-break-no-windows.md, S1-T2b) — plus the one case that mechanism genuinely
 * can't reach: a session with no console at all. See
