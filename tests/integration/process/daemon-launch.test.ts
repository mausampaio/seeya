/**
 * `adapters/process/daemon-launch.ts#spawnDetachedDaemon` (S4-T3, D-005) against a REAL child
 * process — reusing `tests/fixtures/process/graceful-child.mjs` (S1-T2's own fixture) rather than a
 * new one: it already does exactly what this test needs (stay alive, signal a marker file when its
 * handlers are registered, react to SIGTERM), and it's the one already excluded from
 * `verificar-termos-locais`'s scan the same way every fixture is.
 *
 * **What this test proves, and what it does NOT.** It proves the spawned process is real, alive,
 * and independently signalable (a normal OS process, not something broken by `detached`/`stdio:
 * 'ignore'`). It does NOT prove the process outlives the test runner's OWN process — that would
 * require the test process itself to exit and something else to check afterward, which no
 * automated test in this suite can do to itself. See this task's own report for the SEPARATE manual
 * verification (spinning up the real CLI in one shell invocation, checking the child from another)
 * that this in-process test structurally cannot cover.
