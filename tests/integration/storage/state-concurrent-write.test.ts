/**
 * S4-T4 introduces the first REAL reader+writer pair for `estado.json`/`config.json`: `seeya
 * snooze`/`skip-today`/`config` write from a separate terminal while a running daemon's
 * `scheduler/poll.ts` reads (`estado.json`) or reads (`config.json`) on every 30s cycle.
 * `atomic-write.ts`'s own module comment flagged this exact gap as unmeasured before this task —
 * "não há chamador que leia e escreva `config.json` concorrentemente... remedir antes de assumir
 * que continua sem problema". This file is that remeasurement, against real `fs` operations
 * (`StorageAdapter`, not mocked), hammering both sides at once.
 *
 * **What `writeFileAtomic`'s own comment already predicts, and what this test checks for.** On
 * Windows, `rename` over a destination another process holds open for reading fails with `EPERM` —
 * measured once already, in `atomic-write.test.ts`, for a kill-mid-write scenario. This test asks a
 * different question: under REAL, sustained concurrent read+write pressure (not a single kill),
 * does that race actually fire, how often, and does a reader ever observe anything worse than
 * "old value, new value, or briefly absent" (a torn write, a validation error)?
 *
 * **Measured on this machine (Windows), 2026-09-06 (Q-056/S4-T4), 300 concurrent read/write
 * iterations, 3 runs: the write side hit `EPERM` for real, and often — 60/300, 64/300, 56/300
 * (~19-21%).** The reader side never once threw or saw a corrupted document across all 3 runs
 * (0/300 read errors every time) — `writeFileAtomic`'s rename-based swap really does keep every
 * reader looking at either the fully-old or fully-new document, exactly as advertised. Before
 * S4-T4b, the WRITER'S OWN promise rejected with a raw `EPERM` on that fraction of calls whenever a
 * reader happened to have the destination file open for reading at the instant of `rename`, and
 * nothing caught or retried it: it propagated all the way to `cli/index.ts`'s top-level `.catch`.
 *
 * **S4-T4b (Q-058) added a bounded retry inside `writeFileAtomic` — re-measured here, same
 * machine, same 300-iteration/3-run shape: 3/300, 5/300, 1/300 (~0.3-1.7%).** Same instrument,
 * before and after, is the point: a ~19-21% writer rejection rate is now ~1%, and the invariant
 * this test exists to protect — 0/300 reader-side corruption — is unchanged. See
 * `atomic-write.ts`'s own module comment for the full attempt-count tuning table and why
 * `MAX_RENAME_ATTEMPTS = 8`, and docs/QUESTOES.md Q-058 for the full writeup (why the fix lives
 * entirely inside `writeFileAtomic` rather than a `Clock`-injected backoff threaded through
 * `StorageAdapter`). What's left after 8 attempts is no longer a raw `EPERM` — it's a message that
 * names the file and says it's still locked (AGENTS.md § "Mensagens de erro"), which is what the
 * assertion below checks for instead of the old `/EPERM/` pattern.
