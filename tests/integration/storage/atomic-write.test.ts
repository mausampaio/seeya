/**
 * Proves docs/ARQUITETURA.md's atomic-write claim by execution, not by trusting the
 * temp-then-rename pattern's reputation (docs/PLANO-DE-ENTREGA.md S1-T5's explicit ask, and
 * docs/TESTES.md § "storage/": "matar no meio da escrita não pode deixar arquivo pela metade").
 * Kills a REAL child process partway through writing, then inspects what's actually on disk. An
 * in-process unit test calling `writeFileAtomic` and throwing an exception can't reproduce this —
 * nothing short of an actual OS-level kill exercises the failure mode this guards against (the
 * process disappearing between "temp file has some bytes" and "rename has happened").
 *
 * tests/fixtures/storage/slow-atomic-write.mjs is a standalone reimplementation of
 * src/adapters/storage/atomic-write.ts's algorithm (why standalone: see that fixture's own
 * comment) — writes many chunks to a temp file with a short delay between each, so there's a wide
 * window in which to land a kill signal mid-write, then only renames if every chunk succeeds.
 *
 * Killed at several different offsets per docs/TESTES.md-style measurement discipline (same
 * spirit as S1-T0's "40 rounds, zero failures"): a single lucky kill timing proves less than
 * several different ones all landing on the same guarantee.
