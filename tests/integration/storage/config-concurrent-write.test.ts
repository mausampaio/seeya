/**
 * The `config.json` counterpart of `state-concurrent-write.test.ts` — see that file's module
 * comment for the full context (Q-056). `config.json` is actually the NEWER case: before S4-T4,
 * `saveConfig` didn't exist at all, so `config.json` never had a writer in production, only many
 * readers (`buildCliContext`/`buildEndDayContext`/`buildStartDayContext`/`buildDaemonContext`, one
 * `readConfig()` each). This is the very first measurement of a `config.json` writer racing a
 * reader — `atomic-write.ts`'s own module comment named this exact gap before it existed.
 *
 * **Measured on this machine (Windows), 2026-09-06 (Q-056/S4-T4), 300 concurrent read/write
 * iterations, 3 runs: 63/300, 63/300, 55/300 (~18-21%) writes hit `EPERM`, 0/300 reads ever saw a
 * corrupted document.** Same shape and same order of magnitude as `estado.json`'s own measurement
 * in `state-concurrent-write.test.ts` — see that file for the full reasoning (identical mechanism,
 * `writeFileAtomic` underneath both).
 *
 * **S4-T4b (Q-058) re-measured after adding `writeFileAtomic`'s bounded retry: 7/300, 1/300, 1/300
 * (~0.3-2.3%).** Same before/after story as `estado.json`'s — see that file's module comment and
 * `atomic-write.ts`'s own for the full tuning table and why the fix lives inside `writeFileAtomic`
 * rather than a `Clock`-injected backoff (docs/QUESTOES.md Q-058).
