/**
 * Fakes every native notification command `adapters/notification/` might spawn, so e2e — which
 * runs the REAL compiled `packages/cli/dist/index.js` (`_harness.ts#runSeeya`) — never shows a real OS
 * notification on whatever machine runs the suite (docs/PLANO-DE-ENTREGA.md S4-T1: "não notifique
 * de verdade durante o teste. Ninguém quer o portão cuspindo notificação na tela de quem roda
 * `npm test`"). Every e2e `end-day` run reaches `cli/composition.ts`'s real `notifier`
 * (`adapters/notification/index.ts`), which picks its backend by `process.platform` — only the
 * command matching the CI runner's real OS is ever actually resolved, but this fixture installs a
 * fake for all three uniformly: cheap, and future-proof against that platform check changing shape.
 *
 * Windows needs a REAL compiled `.exe`: `spawn('powershell.exe', args, {shell:false})` resolves
 * strictly by `PATH` + a real executable image — a text file named `.exe` fails to launch at all.
 * Same `csc.exe` technique `tests/integration/generation/_fixtures.ts` already established for
 * `claude.exe`, trimmed down: this fake needs no re-exec, just `exit 0`, since nothing here reads
 * back what it was called with (unlike the fake `claude`, which e2e's OWN assertions inspect).
