/**
 * E2E nº8 (docs/TESTES.md § E2E): "Segunda instância do daemon recusa subir por causa do lock."
 * Runs the COMPILED `dist/cli/index.js` (via `_harness.ts#runSeeya`), spawning a REAL detached
 * daemon worker — this is the one journey in this suite that outlives the `seeya` process that
 * started it, exactly like a real user's machine.
 *
 * **Extended by S4-T5 to also cover `--stop`/`--status`** — the sprint's own aceite groups all
 * three of items 6/7/8 together, but items 6 and 7 remain blocked for reasons unrelated to this
 * task (see this file's own closing comment and docs/TESTES.md's own note, unchanged by S4-T5):
 * item 6 needs a clock-injection point in the compiled binary that still doesn't exist, and the
 * daemon's own default (no `~/.seeya/config.json` written here) keeps `endOfDayTime` at its
 * `null` default, so no capture, no lead-time warning and no `claude` call is ever attempted —
 * the poll this test's daemon runs is always the cheap `'disabled'` branch of `decideSchedule`.
 *
 * No `config.json` is written on purpose: default `endOfDayTime: null` means every poll takes the
 * `'disabled'` branch (`core/schedule.ts`) — no capture, no `claude` call, nothing that could make
 * this journey slow or flaky for reasons unrelated to the lock/stop/status mechanism under test.

// (`seeya snooze`/`seeya skip-today` against a running daemon) was deliberately left ungrouped

// 6/7/8 together as one "full day" journey once 6 stops being blocked, rather than as three
// separate pieces. That blocker is unchanged here — S4-T5 delivers exactly what's newly possible
// (item 8, now proven end to end together with `--stop`/`--status`) and does not force items 6/7
// into a test that would only APPEAR to cover them.
