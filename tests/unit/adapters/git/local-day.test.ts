/**
 * `localDayBounds`/`isWithinLocalDay` — the pure math behind "commits do dia"
 * (docs/PLANO-DE-ENTREGA.md S2-T1). The whole point of these tests is the case the task that
 * requested this adapter names explicitly: a commit made late at night, local time, must not
 * count as "yesterday" just because its UTC instant already rolled over — and the reverse, a
 * commit just after local midnight must not leak into "yesterday" either.
