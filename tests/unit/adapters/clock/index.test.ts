/**
 * `adapters/clock/index.ts#systemClock` (D-019). `now()` was already exercised end to end by

 * the one method that wasn't reached anywhere yet: `sleep()` (S4-T3, added for
 * `scheduler/loop.ts`'s poll cadence, the only production caller of a real timer in this project
 * outside this module).
