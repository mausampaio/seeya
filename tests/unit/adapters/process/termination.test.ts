/**
 * `terminateAbruptly` (S4-T5, `adapters/process/termination.ts`) — the error-interpretation half
 * that doesn't need a real process (docs/TESTES.md § Unidade's own convention for this directory,
 * `liveness.test.ts`: fabricated inputs, no real OS call). The two paths that DO need a real
 * process — actually killing something, and tolerating an already-dead pid for real — are covered
 * by `tests/integration/process/termination.test.ts` instead.
 *
 * `process.kill` itself is mocked here (`vi.spyOn`) rather than fabricated through an injected
 * port: this function is intentionally NOT part of `ProcessControl` (see its own docstring — it
 * exists only for `cli/daemon-command.ts` to end `seeya`'s own daemon, never a discovered
 * session), so there is no port to inject a double through in the first place.
