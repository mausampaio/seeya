/**
 * `processExists`'s `assertValidPid` guard (S1-T12, found while auditing `adapters/process`'s
 * coverage: this file had zero direct tests before this — only exercised indirectly through
 * `isAlive`/`terminateGracefully` integration tests, which always pass a real, valid PID).
 *
 * `processExists` is deliberately NOT `async`: the guard throws synchronously, before any
 * `Promise` is created, so a bad PID surfaces as an immediate throw rather than a rejection one
 * microtask later — `expect(() => ...).toThrow(...)`, not `.rejects`.
