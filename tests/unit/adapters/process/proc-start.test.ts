/**
 * `captureObservedProcStart`'s failure-disambiguation logic (afterFailure in proc-start.ts) is
 * exercised here with a PID that cannot possibly be real (way past any platform's PID_MAX) —
 * every platform's lookup genuinely fails against it, which portably drives every capture
 * strategy into its failure path without needing describe.skipIf. What's being tested is only
 * that the outcome is correctly labeled `processGone` vs `unavailable` based on the injected
 * `recheck` — never the specific OS error text, and (S4-T0f, Q-047) never by way of a real
 * subprocess.
 *
 * **`unavailableRun` stands in for Windows' `powershell.exe` only.** Before this test injected
 * `run`, the `win32` case measured 500-880ms per call on a warm machine — a real `powershell.exe`
 * launch, twice per file — well past what `docs/TESTES.md` promises for the unit faixa ("sem
 * I/O") and exactly what turned one CI run red with vitest's unbudgeted 5000ms default
 * (docs/PLANO-DE-ENTREGA.md S4-T0f). `captureWindows` calls `run` instead of `runForStdout`
 * directly for precisely this reason; production leaves `run` at its default (the real
 * `runForStdout`) and only this test substitutes a fake that resolves instantly with no usable
 * output, driving the exact same failure branch a real, absent PID would. `linux` and `darwin`
 * don't take `run` at all (`unavailableRun` is passed anyway, for a uniform `it.each` call, and is
 * simply ignored on those two branches) — `linux` still reads `/proc/<pid>/stat` for real (a
 * single failed `fs.readFile`, not a spawn) and `darwin` still spawns real `ps` (27-29ms measured,
 * nowhere near `powershell.exe`'s cost, and this is what keeps
 * `spawn-stdout.ts#runForStdout`'s own failure branch covered — see Q-047).
