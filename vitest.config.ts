 * plus 4 read-only snapshots) reaches 32. Summed over all 14 cases in that file: ~180 real `git`
 * launches. `atomic-write.test.ts`'s two `killMidWrite`-based cases spawn a real `node` child
 * (5 and 3 times respectively, `SIGKILL`ed mid-write) for the same reason `proc-start.ts`'s
 * `captureWindows` does: nothing short of an actual OS process death exercises what's being

 * was built from (S4-T10 only looked at `powershell.exe`); S4-T11's own CI evidence (two real

 * shows the real cause reaching further than this file: `guards/eslint-restrictions.test.ts` (real
 * ESLint, 70s in that run) and `guards/dependency-cruiser.test.ts`/`layer-matrix.test.ts` (real
 * dependency-cruiser/AST walks, ~40s each) were running at the exact same wall-clock window as the
 * `integration` project's own default-parallel batch. This move narrows the contention THIS
 * project controls (how many of ITS OWN heavy files land in the same batch); it does not, and

 * Needed in THREE places, measured one at a time rather than assumed: the root `resolve.alias`

 * `server.deps.inline` is what makes the alias apply at all: `@seeya-ai/engine` is a real npm
 * workspace package (a node_modules symlink), so without this Vitest's own dependency
 * optimization treats every import of it as "external" and hands it straight to Node's native
 * resolver — which never sees the alias and resolves through the package's real `exports` map

 * passed (`dist/` existed from an earlier build) but resolved a DIFFERENT module than the alias
 * intended, and v8 coverage attributed every hit to files under `dist/`, which `coverage.include`
 * (below, scoped to packages/engine/src) can never match — every directory under
