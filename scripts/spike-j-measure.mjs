/**
 * Ad-hoc measurement tool for S4-T00 / Q-032 (docs/spikes/J-cache-na-captura.md). NOT wired into
 * package.json on purpose — this task does not touch package.json. Invoke directly:
 *
 *   node scripts/spike-j-measure.mjs turn1
 *   node scripts/spike-j-measure.mjs arm1
 *   node scripts/spike-j-measure.mjs arm2
 *   node scripts/spike-j-measure.mjs arm3   (run again with arm4/arm5/... for extra wait points)
 *
 * S4-T00b (docs/spikes/J-cache-na-captura.md's new section, Q-034/Q-035): which single flag among
 * `--tools ""`/`--system-prompt`/`--json-schema` actually breaks prefix identity, run against a
 * FRESH original session (`turn1b`/`IDS.original2`) since round 1's session is a day stale:
 *
 *   node scripts/spike-j-measure.mjs turn1b
 *   node scripts/spike-j-measure.mjs base                  (all three flags, anchors round 1's arm1)
 *   node scripts/spike-j-measure.mjs no-system-prompt       (the decisive arm)
 *   node scripts/spike-j-measure.mjs no-tools
 *   node scripts/spike-j-measure.mjs no-json-schema
 *   node scripts/spike-j-measure.mjs user-prompt-extraction (only if no-system-prompt confirms)
 *
 * Each step is a SEPARATE process invocation on purpose: the "measure the clock" arms need a real
 * wait between them, and per docs/FLUXO-DE-AGENTES.md's "commite cedo, nunca espere notificação",
 * the operator (agent) sleeps SYNCHRONOUSLY between steps and reads the clock itself — this script
 * never sleeps or waits internally, it only records timestamps so the caller can verify an
 * interval actually elapsed.
 *
 * Real invocations of `claude`, one per step. Costs real money — see the per-call
 * `--max-budget-usd` ceiling below and docs/spikes/J-cache-na-captura.md's invocation count.
 *
 * Console output only: tooling script outside src/, exempt from the "no bare console.log" rule
 * (AGENTS.md § "Registro e saída").
 *
 * Sanitization before writing to disk (AGENTS.md § "Este projeto é de código aberto"): every
 * `--session-id` used here is chosen up front as an obviously-synthetic UUID (<=4 distinct
 * symbols, same convention as docs/spikes/A-resume-headless.md), so `session_id` in the raw output
 * never needs redaction. The one field this script cannot pre-choose — the call-level `uuid` field
 * `claude -p --output-format json` emits — is swept by `sanitizeForCommit` below along with any
 * home-directory path, as a belt-and-suspenders measure the pre-commit guard would otherwise catch
 * anyway (scripts/verificar-termos-locais.mjs).
 *
 * JSDoc types throughout, not just tidiness: `eslint .` runs typed lint rules over every file it
 * doesn't ignore (eslint.config.js), including this one — an untyped parameter here is inferred
 * `any` and cascades into `no-unsafe-*` everywhere it flows, the same class of error the rest of
 * this project avoids with real TypeScript.
